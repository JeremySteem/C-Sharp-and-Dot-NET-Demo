    <h2>Site Styling Decision</h2>
    <p>For this assignment I have decided to use my own custom stylesheet, by linking the css/site.css. I have also added google fonts, and updated the js/site.js file to help with the hamberger dropdown. These are all concepts that I have learned in my first semiester at NAIT, and this is the first time i've tried putting it all together. Fingers crossed that everything works nicely. It's really rewarding to see something built that i understand entirely. The reason I'm not using holiday is because I have no experiance with it and dont understand how it works. I would like to learn more about it so that I can make pretty looking webpages with it, as it seems really clean to use.</p>
